# Then a total of 10 query results given by Bing will show out one by one, with "Title", "Summary" and "URL". You are
# at the same time asked whether this result is relevant or not. You are supposed to input "y/Y" or "n/N" according to
# your personal judgement about the relevance of this exact query result. You should make a clear and unbiased judgement
# otherwise there will be something confusing in the following query round, and you will even hardly get what you want
# from Bing.
